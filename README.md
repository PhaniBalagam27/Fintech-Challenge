# Fintech-Challenge
We challenge you to use this data in a creative way and discover insights and trends. Here are some general example questions we find interesting, but remember these are only to get you thinking and we welcome novel approaches to gaining insights. What are people talking about FinTech on twitter? Which fears and hopes are they expressing towards new technologies or businesses? Which companies and locations are mentioned by twitter users? Where are twitter users posting about FinTech coming from? What other valuable insights about “FinTech” discussions can be extracted using Twitter user metadata?
